# Chapter 2: Intelligent Agents # 

## Agent and Environment 
**Agent:**
- Something that is Perceiving and Reacting to it's Environment 
- Has Attributes it can use to interact with the Environment 
- **Percept Sequence** is the Sequence in-which it Percieves things
- **Agent Function** maps Percept Sequence to Actions 

## Rationality
**Rationality:**
- The ability for an Agent to make Consistent Actions based on Percept Sequences
- Defined by the:
    1. Performance Measure
    2. Agent's Environmental Knowledge
    3. The Available Actions of the Agent
    4. Agent's Percept Sequence to-date

**Performance Measure:**
- Evaluates the Environment Sequence and Intended Goals
- Uses some relevant ratio/formula/percent to grade the agent's performance

**Task Environment:**
- PEAS:
    1. Performance
    2. Environment 
    3. Actuators  (Output Devices)
    4. Sensors     (Input Devices)

## Environment 
**Environment Types:**
1. Fully Observable vs Partially Observable 
    - ( i.e: Chess vs Poker )
2. Single Agent vs Multi-Agent 
    - Multi-Agent can be Cooperative or Competitive
3. Deterministic vs Stochastic 
    - Determined Environment vs Uncertain Environment    
4. Episodal vs Sequential 
    - Independent Actions vs Dependent Actions
5. Static vs Dynamic 
    - Static Environment vs Changing Environment 
6. Discrete vs Continuous
    - Fininite Environment States vs Infinite States
7. Known vs Unknown
    - Known Environment Rules vs Learn Environment Rules
