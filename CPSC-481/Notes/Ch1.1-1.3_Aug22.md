**Importance**
- Near-Objective way of Testing Intelligence 

**Criticisms:**
- Dependent on text-based media 
- Only based on a select series of tasks

### Directions of AI
**Strong AI (AGI)**
- Very General Intelligence
- The 'Main-Goal' of AI Development

**Weak AI**
- Very Specified Intelligence
