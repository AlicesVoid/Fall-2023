# Chapter 1 Intro To Math Modeling

## Math Modeling Process
**NOTE:**
- Keep it simple 
- Not everything can be modeled

1. Derivation
2. Implementation
3. Analysis  (repeat)


### Model Derivation
1. Inquire about the Problem 
2. Beware of Existing Models 
3. Determine the Contributing Factors 
4. Rely on Older-Yet-Related Models (beware)

### Model Implementation 
1. Carry it out in Some Experimental Field (MATLAB)

### Model Analysis 
1. Test for Violation
2. Test for Consistency
3. Validate Results 
4. Check for Comparissons

## Units and Conversions 
**NOTE:**
- These all have Unit Prefixes

1. Variables
2. Parameters


### Principle Units 
1. length | meter
2. mass | gram
3. time | second
4. current | ampere
5. temp | kelvin
6. amount | mole
7. luminosity | candela
8. computer | byte 

### Common Derived Units 
1. Velocity | (Duh)
2. Force | Newton's
3. Energy | Joule
4. Power | Watt 
5. Freq | Hertz
6. Pressure | Pascal
