# Introduction to Matlab 

## Concepts 
**Script Language**
- Doesn't Require Compiling 
- Just kinda- run it!

## QOL
- `save a_result A`
    - Saves the content of variable A to a file named "a_result" for future use.
- `load a_result`
    - Loads the data from the file "a_result" into the workspace, making it available for use.
- `F5`
    - runs the currently selected or active script or code. (WINDOWS)
- `F9`
    - used to execute the currently selected or highlighted code section or line. (WINDOWS)

## Matrices 
- `A = [a_11 a12; a21 a22]`
    - Creates a 2x2 Matrix named A.
- `A(r, c)`
    - Accesses the element in row r and column c of matrix A.
- `A_transpose = A'`
    - Creates the transpose of matrix A, denoted as A_transpose.
- `length(A)`
    - Returns the length of the largest dimension of matrix A.
- `size(A) | size(A, 1) | size(A, 2)`
    - Returns the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of matrix A.
