# Chapter 14 Dimensions & Compatibility #

## Units 
**The Three Fundamental Units:**
1. Mass 
2. Length
3. Time 
Many Units can be expressed as Dimensions
-Some Units are Dimensionless 

**Notation:**
- [ ] implies "dimension of this variable"
    - ( i.e: [density] = M/V )
    - Protected under Add. & Scalar Mult.
    - [C] = 1
    - [0] = whatever you want
    - [-x] = [x]

**In-Class Pressure Example**
- L.S. We want [dP/dz] for pressure P and length z
1. [dP/dz] = [dP]/[dz] = [Pascal]/L
2. [N/m^2^]/L = [kg*m/(s^2^)(m^2^)]/L
3. ...= M / (T^2^)(L^2^)

**In-Class Fluid Flow Example:**
- L.S. we want Kinematic Viscosity V?
- dv/dt = -V(d2v/dx2 + d2v/dy2)
1. [-V] = [dv/dt] / [d^2^v/dx^2^] + [d^2^v/dy^2^]
2. ...= ((L/T)/T)/((L/T)/L^2^)
3. ...= (L^2^)/T
